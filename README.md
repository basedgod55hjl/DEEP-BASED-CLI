## C++ Website Mapper Example

An example C++ utility is included in `tools/website_mapper.cpp`. It fetches a
webpage and prints all hyperlinks and button labels it finds.

### Build

```bash
g++ tools/website_mapper.cpp -o tools/website_mapper -lcurl
```

### Run

```bash
tools/website_mapper https://example.com
```

### Web UI

A simple web interface is available to run the mapper from your browser.

```bash
# build the C++ mapper if you haven't already
g++ tools/website_mapper.cpp -o tools/website_mapper -lcurl

# start the web server
node tools/website_mapper_server.js
```

Then open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and enter a URL to
see the discovered links and button labels.
