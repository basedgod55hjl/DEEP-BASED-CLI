- **Parameter Validation**: Schema-based validation with detailed error messages
- **Tool Registry**: Centralized tool management with aliases and categorization
- **Execution History**: Tracking of tool usage and performance metrics
- **Location Tracking**: File system impact awareness for safety

**Key Classes**:
```python
class EnhancedBaseTool(ABC):
    - validate_tool_params()
    - should_confirm_execute()  
    - execute_with_validation()
    - get_execution_stats()

class ToolRegistry:
    - register_tool()
    - get_tool()
    - list_tools()
    - get_tools_by_category()
```

### 2. Advanced File Operations ✅

**Inspired by**: Gemini CLI's file manipulation tools (read-file, write-file, edit, grep, glob)

**Implementation**: `tools/enhanced_file_tool.py`

**Features**:
- **Smart File Reading**: Automatic encoding detection, size limits, metadata extraction
- **Safe File Writing**: Automatic backups, directory creation, error recovery

- **File Analysis**: Content analysis, type detection, statistics
- **Directory Listing**: Detailed file information, sorting, filtering
- **Glob Patterns**: Advanced pattern matching for file discovery

**Operations**:
```python
operations = [
    "read",     # Smart file reading with encoding detection
    "write",    # Safe writing with backup and validation  
    "edit",     # In-place editing with safety checks
    "search",   # Regex search with context
    "analyze",  # File analysis and statistics
    "list",     # Enhanced directory listing
    "glob"      # Pattern-based file discovery
]
```

### 3. Enhanced Memory System ✅

**Inspired by**: Gemini CLI's memory management with semantic search

**Implementation**: `tools/enhanced_memory_tool.py`

**Features**:
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search using embeddings
- **Memory Types**: Categorized storage (facts, procedures, conversations, code, etc.)
- **Smart Storage**: Duplicate detection, importance scoring, tagging
- **Advanced Retrieval**: Multiple search strategies, similarity thresholds
- **Memory Analytics**: Usage patterns, type distribution, access statistics
- **Context Awareness**: Related memory discovery and clustering

**Memory Types**:
```python
class MemoryType:
    FACT = "fact"
    PROCEDURE = "procedure" 
    CONVERSATION = "conversation"
    CODE_SNIPPET = "code_snippet"
    FILE_REFERENCE = "file_reference"
    TASK = "task"
    INSIGHT = "insight"
```

### 4. Streaming & Real-time Updates ✅

**Inspired by**: Gemini CLI's real-time response streaming

**Implementation**: Enhanced across multiple tools

**Features**:
- **Progress Callbacks**: Real-time status updates during execution
- **Streaming API Support**: Chunked responses for long operations
- **Live Output**: Character-by-character code generation updates
- **Operation Tracking**: Execution progress with time estimates
- **Cancellation Support**: Graceful termination of long-running operations

### 5. Enhanced DeepSeek Integration ✅

**Inspired by**: Gemini CLI's AI model integration patterns

**Implementation**: Enhanced `tools/deepseek_coder_tool.py`

**New Features**:
- **Context Awareness**: Language-specific prompting and best practices
- **Tool Registry**: Built-in tools for enhanced functionality
- **Streaming Code Generation**: Real-time code generation with progress
- **Execution History**: Track usage patterns and performance
- **Enhanced Prompting**: Context-aware prompt enhancement

**Enhanced Methods**:
```python
async def execute_with_streaming(operation, update_callback, **kwargs)
def _enhance_prompt_with_context(prompt, language)
def list_available_tools()
def get_execution_history()
```

## Architecture Integration

### Compatibility Layer

All enhancements maintain full backward compatibility with existing DEEP-CLI architecture:

```python
# Legacy wrapper for existing tools
class EnhancedFileProcessor(BaseTool):
    def __init__(self):
        self.enhanced_tool = EnhancedFileTool()
    
    async def execute(self, **kwargs) -> ToolResponse:
        # Convert between new and legacy formats
```

### Error Handling

Enhanced error types and handling inspired by Gemini CLI:

```python
class ToolErrorType(Enum):
    VALIDATION_ERROR = "validation_error"
    EXECUTION_ERROR = "execution_error"
    PERMISSION_ERROR = "permission_error"
    TIMEOUT_ERROR = "timeout_error"
    NETWORK_ERROR = "network_error"
    RESOURCE_ERROR = "resource_error"
```

### Configuration Integration

Enhanced tools integrate seamlessly with existing DEEP-CLI configuration:

- Uses existing DeepSeek API configuration
